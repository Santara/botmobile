 Method
 ======
 
 1. DQN (discrete action space)
 2. Policy gradient (continuous action space)
 3. Imitation learning (faster to converge?)
 
 Features
 ========
 
 1. continuous case - angle, dist, speed
 2. discrete case - 19 sensors, speed?
 
 Rewards
 =======
 
 1. Advancement on track - positive
 2. Going out of track - huge? negative
 3. Distance from center of track - negative?
 
 Metric
 ======

 1. distFromStart (when crashing or finishing race) - average, maximum, stddev
 2. curLapTime
 3. lastLapTime 
 
 Plots
 =====
 
 1. Where the car crashes
 2. Linear model coefficients
 
 Misc
 ====
 
 1. Text mode racing (restart crashes Torcs)
 2. Better keyboard control?
    * Accelerate only when pushing the up button
    * Automatic gear change
    * Automatic reverse when pushing down button?
 3. Windows/Mac support.
